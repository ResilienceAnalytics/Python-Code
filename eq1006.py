# Importing SymPy for symbolic mathematics
import sympy as sp

# Defining the symbols F_A, V, and U_P
F_A, V, U_P = sp.symbols('F_A V U_P', positive=True, real=True)

# Defining the equation (partial F_A / F_A) + (partial V / V) = (partial U_P / U_P)
eq = sp.Eq(sp.diff(F_A)/F_A + sp.diff(V)/V, sp.diff(U_P)/U_P)

# Solving the equation for U_P (optional)
solution = sp.solve(eq, U_P)

# Adding comments to explain each step
# Here, we have defined a symbolic equation based on the provided expression.
# The symbols F_A, V, and U_P are assumed to be positive real numbers.
# The equation is then solved for U_P, but you can also solve it for other variables if needed.
